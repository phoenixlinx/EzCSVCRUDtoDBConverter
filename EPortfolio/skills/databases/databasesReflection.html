                <h2>What challenges did you face as you were improving the artifact?</h2>
                <ul>
                    One significant challenge was modularizing the code without degrading performance. Another was understanding the original 
                    codeâ€™s intent without adequate comments or documentation.
                </ul>

                <h2>What lessons did you learn?</h2>
                <ul>
                    Enhancing this artifact taught me the importance of balancing modularity and performance. The difficulty of debugging and refactoring my own legacy code taught me the value of intent-based documentation.
                </ul>

                <h2>Which computer science professional standards did your SED enhancements fully address?</h2>
                <ul>
                    SED improvements partially addressed CS standards III, IV, and V.
