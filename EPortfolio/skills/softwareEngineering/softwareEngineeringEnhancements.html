    <h3>SED Component: Modularizing EzCSV Functionality</h3>


    <section>
        <h4>Why Did You Enhance This Component?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>EzCSVCRUDtoDBConverter.cpp fits the definition of the Blob anti-pattern. It handles most of the application’s many responsibilities. The system consists of just two files: EzCSVCRUDtoDBConverter.cpp and CSVparser.cpp. This design made it very challenging and impractical to make changes to the old system. Even a small change to one part of the system often profoundly affected many other parts. Additionally, reusing individual EzCSV functions in other projects required much effort because its functions were highly dependent on other EzCSV functions and variables. As a result, the complexity of EzCSV not only made maintenance difficult but also made the system prone to vulnerabilities, as its complexity obscured its flaws.</li>
     
        </ul>

    <section>
        <h4>How Was the Component Enhanced?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Enhanced maintainability, reusability, and security by breaking down complex files, classes, and functions into smaller, manageable units that follow the Single Responsibility Principle.</li>

    <section>
        <h4>Skills Demonstrated by Component Enhancements</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Code refactoring demonstrates the ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals because it solves the issues that stem from the blob anti-pattern by employing effective CS techniques.
            </li>
            <li> Modular design is evidence of the ability to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices because it employs core CS standards to optimize flexibility and maintainability while addressing its trade-offs, such as the need for careful planning and potential performance reductions due to additional function calls.
            </li>
            <li> Detecting and mitigating security vulnerabilities illustrates  a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources since the simplicity of modular code  makes it easy to identify its flaws.
